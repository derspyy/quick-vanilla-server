# Quick Vanilla Server ðŸ’¨
This is a quilt minecraft modpack focused on delivering the quickest vanilla experience with optimization mods and very basic management features. My wish is to make this a modpack for few people to play on without the need to go after updating mods.

## Installation:
To install this modpack you'll need to use the [Packwiz Installer](https://github.com/packwiz/packwiz-installer-bootstrap/releases).
1) Set up a quilt server.
2) Download packwiz-installer-bootstrap.jar to your server's folder.
3) Run the command: 
`java -jar packwiz-installer-bootstrap.jar -g -s server https://derspyy.github.io/quick-vanilla-server/pack.toml`

_This can be run before server startup to automatically update the modpack._
